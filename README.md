Hi there, welcome to my data analysis projects. Here's a couple of projects I have worked in the past.

The first project analyzes the Cost of Living Index across different cities/countries, comparing factors like housing, transportation, groceries, and healthcare. The goal is to identify trends, affordability levels, and economic disparities using data-driven insights. Here are some key insights:

✅ Cities with the highest and lowest cost of living
✅ Factors driving high expenses (rent, food, transportation)
✅ Regional trends and comparisons
✅ Interactive visualizations for better understanding

The second project analyzes Steam sales data to uncover trends in game pricing, discounts, genres, and user reviews. The goal is to identify factors influencing sales performance and provide insights for game developers, publishers, and gamers. Here are some key insights:

✅ Most popular game genres based on sales revenue
✅ Impact of discounts on game sales performance
✅ Price trends and seasonal sales patterns
✅ Correlation between reviews and sales
